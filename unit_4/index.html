			<h3>Creative Consulting</h3>
			<p> Every company, organization or self-employed person has its own special uniqueness that is key to commercial prosperity. Together we just need to work out how to untap and maximize that potential. Often this means going right back to the roots - clarifying the intention behind your business, what your core services are, your point of difference, and how to communicate all of that to the world. Easy peasy! </p>
